~ Functionality: 3. This was straightforward, I have the methods successfully implemented and they run on the command line.

~ OOP: 3. I believe I did very well on single responsibility which allowed for great test coverage and keeping the length of my methods short. I believe everything is broken down logically, which helps me to be able to explain everything.

~ Ruby Conventions: 3. I believe my syntax, and naming follow convention. I think I also found the best tool for the job as often as possible. I have 1 hash.

~ TDD: 3.6. I wrote tests before methods, and my tests have a single responsibility. I tested edge cases, my test coverage is 100% and I used stubs in several tests and can speak to how they enhanced my tests.  

~ Version Control: 3.5. I have at least 40 commits, clearly documented and grouped into logical chunks.
